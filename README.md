# Shun4MIDI-Bot
Future Discord Bot for the Shun4MIDI project, probably coded in C++ (Yes, I promised I would return to deving in June when the semester ends, I would keep my promise)

Yes, there is a possibility Shun4MIDI would be a Discord Bot before it is a website or a library (Probably a C++ library because I'm biased and there are so few libraries in C++ with something this cool), because I cannot get myself to code sometimes for the life of me but use Discord too much :|

Also, yes, this summer I am not only deving, I have other stuff to do (that are also frankly more interesting), so don't expect this to be done by the end of the summer holiday or whatever, but expect quite a few functionalities in place?

## Details
This is dedicated to the 2021-2023 Shun who still used to [compose Music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNU0zx5wI3Q) and wanted a more advanced Music Theory tool to help him without needing to do the theory by hand or in his head :) I don't really compose anymore since I don't have the time but I love composing still, at heart. :)

Priority would be placed on Jazz theory and more "obscure" theory such as quartal harmony, whole-tone harmony, etc first since that is my niche in music, although there would definitely be basic chords and scales coded before those are in place and those are quite universal. I am a Jazz-trained musical composer(*), not classical-trained, so it may affect my view on this project!

<i>(*) Ex-composer? I didn't quit officially but I didn't compose in one to two years ever since the first winter holiday ended after I entered college... I'm so busy... I don't even have much time to code this, let alone literally compose.</i>

Like how Math or CS has more theory based people, I consider myself to be *very* theoretical in terms of my passion in Music and Musical composition, so it may not have much purpose for your average contemporary composer? I like to compose in these niche genres (Not talking about Jazz) because I like theory, and I would thus prioritize that first.

## Remark
I would support microtonal notation like half-sharps and half-flats, don't mistake that. However, by me saying I won't dive into "microtonal harmony", I moreso mean harmony that isn't the typical major/minor/12-TET inspired harmony. For example, what is it like to not only consider half steps but for example, quarter steps between notes in a chord? Yes, as a more Math-ey person, I used to be **very obsessed** with microtonal composition, and have thus read up on microtonal theory (and composed some microtonal pieces produced on Logic Pro too :>). Trust me, there is a difference between supporting microtonal notes with 12-TET inspired harmony adapted to microtonality and actually having microtonal harmony. If you don't trust me, look at Jacob Collier's music ðŸ˜‚. I am a *bit* more rusty about microtonal harmony now that I haven't done it in more than two years, but it is an interest of mine. Feel free to talk to me more about it if you want.
